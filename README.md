Our project aims to determine whether economic differences between different states promote the inter-state migrations of American citizens. We hypothesized that economic performance (specifically in-state median salary and Gross Domestic Product) would be positively correlated with the change of population in U.S. states, resulting in an increasing state population, whereas housing prices would be negatively correlated with the change of population. We predicted that the quality of life is the largest factor that affects the migration rate, and that in-state median salary, Gross Domestic Product, and housing prices are the three major standard measures for the quality of life in a state. To investigate our hypothesis, we used official data from the US Census Bureau from 2010-2019 to examine trends and relationships between population change and in-state median salary, GDP, and housing prices.
